Hi! I’m Enrique, a data scientist with hands-on experience in over 15 applied projects. My expertise includes business analytics, data visualization, machine learning, and Python. I'm passionate about using data to make high-impact decisions. I'm eager to deploy my skills and apply them to bring solutions and drive growth to businesses.

My recent experience includes the 8-month Data Science Program taken in 2024. The curriculum spanned over numerous things, including Python (NumPy and Pandas), SQL, machine learning (scikit-learn, NLTK, Keras), time series analysis (ARIMA), statistical data analysis, computer vision, and more. I completed a number of applied projects which were reviewed by expert coders and continuously tuned until we had met standards. This experience enhanced my ability to analyze, visualize, and present data in a clear, digestible format while improving my coding and model-building skills. 

My projects were a demonstration of each skill I learned during the program. You can learn about select projects in my repositories which include supervised learning, time series analysis, and gradient boosting methods.

Some facts about me:
- Huge fan of basketball and baseball.
- A numbers nerd, especially in sports stats, crypto, and stocks.
- Almost always top-tier at every video game I play.
- Looking to land my dream data science job in 2024/2025!
